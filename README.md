XSS | Obtaining user information illegally
=======================

API that returns random images while collecting the user's public IP and geolocating it in order to carry out an XSS attack.

Used in a security audit to a website where an escalation of privileges has been achieved. 

All images on the site have been changed to those of our API in order to obtain information from users, create a database of people with their likes and be able to sell it on the Dark Web to create SPAM lists.
